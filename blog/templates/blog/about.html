He is a life transformation coach who mentors other <br/>personal trainers and coaches in learning Next Generation transformational processes, helping them to build a 6-figure income each year.<br/><br/>He is the host of The 100k Coach’s Podcast &amp; a board member of the National Speakers Association. Travis has been featured on every major television<br/>station and numerous radio and podcast channels talking about Next Generation Coaching Processes that help leaders gain the skills to transform lives <br/>faster. He speaks for major associations, businesses, seminars and host’s his own events.<br/><br/>Travis Brady’s Story…<br/><br/>I have been in the coaching industry for collectively 16 years and a speaker for 7 years.<br/><br/>I love it! I love what I do!<br/><br/>What I love most is helping other personal trainers, coaches, and speakers create a transformational business that impacts people’s lives and in return <br/>creates for them a 6-figure plus income!<br/><br/>It’s been awesome to be featured on tv, radio and podcasts. I love speaking to audiences and hosting my own events.<br/><br/>I live the life I’ve always wanted.<br/><br/>But it wasn’t like that at first. I struggled just making a decent pay check to survive.<br/><br/>I wasted years on a Bachelor’s degree that didn’t do much. Spent money on certifications that just confused me more with information.<br/><br/>If it wasn’t for my mom inspiring me to continue I would have dropped off like so many friends and people in this industry.<br/><br/>Here’s the thing.<br/><br/>I wasn’t any better than them. I just learned the right way to do it.<br/><br/>I learned how to be unique, offer more value in my programs, get higher paying programs, and market myself while learning the ins and outs of business.<br/><br/>But the biggest thing that allowed me to create my business is TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS.<br/><br/>Tools that help people transform their mindset and hidden unconscious beliefs faster than anything I’ve ever seen or been taught. They are truly Next <br/>Generation coaching concepts that I’ve learned through various other high-level mentors that NOBODY is using! Which is crazy!<br/><br/>When I started applying these tools with my clients they got better results. They started telling more people. I started getting more referrals and making more <br/>$$$.<br/><br/>Through learning them I now feel this infinite purpose in my life to pass them onto other influencers who feel they have a divine purpose to help people and <br/>who want to level up their business to 6-figures and beyond.<br/><br/>I now have dedicated my purpose to teach coaches, trainers, and speakers LIKE YOU how to take these tools and apply it to your hidden gifts to create a big <br/>IMPACT &amp; INCOME.<br/><br/>Please reach out to me on here or social media and let me know how I can help you create a bigger transformation in the world and a bigger income while <br/>you’re doing it.<br/><br/>Be Inspired. Be Strong.<br/><br/>The World Needs You.<br/><br/></p>
